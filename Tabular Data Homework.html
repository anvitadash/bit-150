<p>-Some cells are Empty: Sex and Weight for 1/8/14: NA, 1/8/14: OL, 1/8/14: OT, 1/8/14: OX. As the paper mentions, to fix this, use a common code for missing data like a hyphen</p> 
<p>-The dates are in the format “1/8/14” which is okay because it is consistent but the preferred format is: 2014-01-14</p> 
<p>-Ensuring that the spreadsheet is in rectangular format after filling in the missing data with a common code</p> 
<p>-The header row, “Plot 2” should be a single row and not divided into columns</p>
<p>-A data dictionary that explains all of the variables, the units, and expected min/max values</p>
<p>-There is data that is highlighted but instead a column should be added that has an indicator variable like true or false</p>
